Deutsche Telekom's honeypot project was started in 2010 by a small group of enthusiasts. We initially started with Lukas Rist's great [Glastopf web honeypot](http://glastopf.org/) and soon added further honeypot daemons like [kippo](https://github.com/desaster/kippo), [honeytrap](http://honeytrap.carnivore.it/) and [dionaea](http://dionaea.carnivore.it/). Over the next years we deployed more and more honeypots.

Data captured on our honeypot sensors is visualized on our [Sicherheitstacho](http://www.sicherheitstacho.eu) and we further use the information
e.g. to inform our customers regarding infections.

We currently run about 180 honeypot sensors as part of Deutsche Telekom's early warning system. Individual maintenance of such large number of systems became a time consuming and painful task. As a first step we created a standardized Raspberry PI honeypot image, which is managed by Puppet and distributed across our national subsidiaries. To increase the efficiency even more, we decided to build T-Pot, a highly modular approach.

### Initial Jekyll template written by Dirk Fabisch

A medium inspired Jekyll blog theme. The basic idea came from the Ghost theme 
[Readium 2.0](http://www.svenread.com/readium-ghost-theme/). I use mediator on my own blog [The Base](blog.base68.com).

You can **download** the theme here:
